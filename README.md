# Simple Linear Regression

Welcome to the Simple Linear Regression project! This repository contains a detailed Jupyter Notebookand a dataset that demonstrates the process of building a simple linear regression model.

## Project Overview

Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental technique in statistical learning and data science, used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. This notebook will guide you through the steps of data preparation, model training, and evaluation using a real-world dataset.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about age and premium amounts. Here are some key details:

- **Features:**
  - **Age:** The age of individuals (in years).
  - **Premium:** The premium amount (in currency units).

- **Summary:**
  - The dataset contains 7 entries.
  - Both features are numerical and have no missing values.

| Age | Premium |
|-----|---------|
| 18  | 10000   |
| 22  | 15000   |
| 23  | 18000   |
| 26  | 21000   |
| 28  | 24000   |
| 33  | 27000   |

## Key Features

- **Data Loading and Exploration:** Understand the dataset by loading it into a Pandas DataFrame and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Data Visualization:** Utilize libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the relationships between variables.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Building:** Implement a simple linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- **Prediction:** Make predictions using the trained model and visualize the results.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for this project.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment for developing and presenting data science projects.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.
